                <h2>About The Kat</h2>
                <p>Kit Kat is a chocolate covered wafer bar candy which was originally designed in York, United Kingdom. It was originally
                created by Rowntree's which was later purchased by Nestle in 1988 which is the company who makes the bar today.The name originates from the 18th century
                when mutton pies known as Kit Cat were served at meetings of the Kit-Cat Club in London. During the first world war the chocolate was changed to dark chocolate
                and the packaging was changed to blue due to supply issues. After the war the original milk chocolate returned as well as the now well known red packaging. When
                Rowntree's was purchased by Nestle in June 1988 they had global control over the distribution of the brand, except in the US where the Hershey company had bought
                the rights to the chocolate before the company was bought by Nestle. This ownership of distribution is the same to this day. </p>
